## 🧠 Multi-Agent Playground — Pick Your Vibe

### ✨ **Agno** — Clean & Chill Dev Experience

**[agno_hello/](./src/agno_hello/)**

Agno basically gives a color-coded "brain dump" 🧠✨ — shows your prompt, breaks it into reasoning steps, logs any tool calls, then drops the final answer + response time. Super handy for debugging or peeking under the hood.

### 💬 **AutoGen** — R&D Buddy (Great for Conversations)

**[autogen\_dev_team/](./src/autogen_dev_team/)**

AutoGen is used when you need to **automatically generate** code, text, or content based on specific parameters or templates to improve efficiency and consistency in production workflows.

Wanna simulate a lil dev team in your terminal? AutoGen's got two AI agents vibing together — one writes Python sorting algos, the other roasts and fixes the code through back-and-forth convos. Perfect for tinkering and research.

### ⚡ **CrewAI** — Rapid Prototyping Squad

**[crewai\_dev_team/](./src/crewai_stock_alert_system/)**

🔍 Detailed execution traces are available!                                                            

View insights including:                                                                     

* Agent decision-making process                                                         
* Task execution flow and timing                                           
* Tool usage details

CrewAI is like assembling a mini Avengers team of AI agents. Each plays a role, and together they crush complex tasks through structured collabs. Super fast to set up and prototype.

### 📚 **LangChain RAG Agent** — Context Is King

**[langchain\_rag_agent/](./src/langchain_rag_agent/)**

A classic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setup built on LangChain. If your agents need some *receipts* (a.k.a. context), this one's your go-to.

---

### 🔁 **LangGraph** — Workflow Overlord

**[langgraph_workflows/](./src/langgraph_branching_agent/)**

When things get *complicated™*, LangGraph steps in. It's built for complex, cyclical workflows with human-in-the-loop interactions and advanced state management. Nerds, assemble 🧑‍💻

---

### ✅ **PydanticAI** — Type Safety, But Make It Fun

**[pydantic\_ai_example/](./src/pydantic_ai_example/)**

**[type\_safe_news_agent/](./src/type_safe_news_agent/)**

This one keeps your code ✨unbreakable✨ thanks to Pydantic validation. If you love strict typing and hate runtime surprises, you'll vibe with this.

PydanticAI is an framework that leverages Pydantic for data validation and settings management in Python, enabling developers to build applications with type-safe data models and automatic validation.

### 🪶 **SmolAgents** — Tiny but Mighty

**[smol_agents/](./src/smolagents_hello/)**

For quick side projects or lightweight setups, SmolAgents is the minimalist framework that lets you build fast without a dependency overload. Easy. Breezy. Smol.

SmolAgents gives colorized diagnostics.
