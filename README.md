## 🛠️ Projects

### AutoGen Multi-Agent Development

💬 AutoGen – Chat-based agent research (ideal for R&D and convos)

**[autogen\_dev_team/](./src/autogen_dev_team/)**

Simulates a mini development team using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. Two AI agents collaborate: one generates Python sorting algorithms while another tests and critiques the code through iterative conversations.

### LangChain RAG Agent
**[langchain\_rag_agent/](./src/langchain_rag_agent/)**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation using LangChain for building context-aware AI agents.

### 🔍 Agentic AI Frameworks

🔁 LangGraph – Handles complex workflows (good for nerdy/structured stuff)

⚡ CrewAI – Fast way to build agents that work together (great for prototyping)

✨ Agno – Super clean dev experience (friendly for most devs)

✅ PydanticAI – Type-safe agents (you won't break things easily)

🪶 SmolAgents – Minimalistic, lightweight (perfect for side projects)
