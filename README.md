## 🧠 Multi-Agent Playground — Pick Your Vibe

### ✨ **Agno** — Clean & Chill Dev Experience

**[agno_hello/](./src/agno_hello/)**

Think of Agno as the “nice guy” of frameworks — super intuitive APIs, smooth workflows, and overall just *pleasant* to build collaborative AI systems with. No stress, just vibes.

### 💬 **AutoGen** — R&D Buddy (Great for Conversations)

**[autogen\_dev_team/](./src/autogen_dev_team/)**

Wanna simulate a lil dev team in your terminal? AutoGen’s got two AI agents vibing together — one writes Python sorting algos, the other roasts and fixes the code through back-and-forth convos. Perfect for tinkering and research.

### ⚡ **CrewAI** — Rapid Prototyping Squad

**[crewai\_dev_team/](./src/crewai_dev_team/)**

CrewAI is like assembling a mini Avengers team of AI agents. Each plays a role, and together they crush complex tasks through structured collabs. Super fast to set up and prototype.

### 📚 **LangChain RAG Agent** — Context Is King

**[langchain\_rag_agent/](./src/langchain_rag_agent/)**

A classic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setup built on LangChain. If your agents need some *receipts* (a.k.a. context), this one’s your go-to.

---

### 🔁 **LangGraph** — Workflow Overlord

**[langgraph_workflows/](./src/langgraph_workflows/)**

When things get *complicated™*, LangGraph steps in. It’s built for complex, cyclical workflows with human-in-the-loop interactions and advanced state management. Nerds, assemble 🧑‍💻

### ✅ **PydanticAI** — Type Safety, But Make It Fun

**[pydantic_agents/](./src/pydantic_agents/)**

This one keeps your code ✨unbreakable✨ thanks to Pydantic validation. If you love strict typing and hate runtime surprises, you’ll vibe with this.

---

### 🪶 **SmolAgents** — Tiny but Mighty

**[smol_agents/](./src/smol_agents/)**

For quick side projects or lightweight setups, SmolAgents is the minimalist framework that lets you build fast without a dependency overload. Easy. Breezy. Smol.
