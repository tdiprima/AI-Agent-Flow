It's actually kinda fire 🔥

Agno basically runs a **full "agent brain scan"** every time you ask something. Here's the TL;DR of what it's doing under the hood:

1. 🧠 **Shows the original user message** (what you asked).
2. 🪄 **Breaks the task into reasoning steps** — it literally walks you through its thought process like:

   * Step 1: Figure out what's being asked
   * Step 2: Recall or compute the answer
   * (and more if the task is complex)
3. 🧰 **Logs tool calls** — if it "thinks" or "analyzes," it lists each internal action it took (with titles, thoughts, results, confidence, etc.) like a mini debugger.
4. ⏱️ **Gives the final answer** with a response time so you can see how long the whole reasoning took.

Basically, Agno turns the agent's usual black-box reasoning into a **color-coded, step-by-step diagnostic dashboard**, so devs can *see exactly why it answered the way it did*.

Perfect for debugging, demos, or just ✨nerding out✨ on agent internals.
